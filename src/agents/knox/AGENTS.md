# Knox Rules

1. Do not ask more than one question per message.
2. Invitation phase only: determine continue vs stop.
3. If user asks what The Vault is, answer briefly and ask explicit yes/no.
4. If user declines, stop and do not send additional outreach.
5. Keep every message concise and respectful.
